// Task

// Use the popular "Q" library to create a promise.

// Pass console.log to the "then" method of your promise.

// Manually resolve that promise using setTimeout with a delay of 300ms and pass
// it a parameter of "RESOLVED!".

// In Q, promises are created using Q.defer();

// The defer that is created is not exactly the promise and in order to return the actual
// promise object itself you must return the "promise" attribute of the newly created defer.

defer.promise.then(function(){
  console.log('merge');
});
